This class is focused on dynamic single page applications.  
Projects include a bar-bell weight callcualtor and a  
mouse click speed game that gives you a Chuch Norris joke if you are fast enough.

This app is optimized for use on a phone clicks and weights can be added and taken off by taping on them as well.

This game starts easy and continues to get harder and harder as the squares that are generated in a new location and move and a faster and faster speed making it harder to click on.  
Some if my favorite things about this program was connecting to an API and learning how to do timers in javascript.
